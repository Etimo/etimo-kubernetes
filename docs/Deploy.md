There are some gotchas to learn when handling stuff in Kubernetes:

- Always use specific tags for Docker images
- How to run one time jobs (e.g. for migrations)
- How to deploy
- How to verify deployment

### <a name='always-use-specific-tags-for-docker-images'></a>Always use specific tags for Docker images

The first thing to think about is to never deploy a docker image using a `latest` tag (or similar static tag). The reasons for this are many:

- You don't know which image you are running
- Recreating pods could cause them to use a different image from other pods
- The tag could be already cached on the Kubernetes node and thus a new one won't be deployed

A best practice is to always deploy an image using a specific tag that is tied to a git commit. So for git commit `abcdef` you should have a corresponding docker image `org/my-app:abcdef`. This will make sure that the right tag is deployed, that it is not cached and that the same tag gets deployed in case of a pod recreation.

### <a name='how-to-run-one-time-jobs'></a>How to run one time jobs

One time jobs are good candidates to use for migrations for example. It is better to have a controlled way of applying migrations instead of trying to do it automatically on application start.

# Host a new project

So you want to host your project in Etimo Kubernetes? Nice, you've come to the right place!

## Prerequisites

To be able to communicate with cluster you will need to have [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) installed on your computer.

## How to get access?

To get access to the cluster you will need a configuration file called `kubeconfig`. This will automatically be generated for you when you provision your first project using these instructions. Further down you can also read more about how to use your kubeconfig.

## Provision a project

Provisioning a project is the process of setting up a project and getting a dedicated namespace assigned for it.
